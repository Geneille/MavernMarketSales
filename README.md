** Discliamer: This project was done as part of a course undertaken in Udemy. The creation of the dashboard was done soley by me, although some parts were guided with text with the course manual. The dashboard highlighting USA sales was not part of the course mandate, but was done as a drill through to further explore the USA sales.
