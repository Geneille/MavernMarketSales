# Maven Market Sales

Maven Market is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. 

The aim of this project was to:
* Build a relational model connecting the different source files
* Add calculated columns and measures, utilizing DAX where applicated to create calculated fields, to further analyze the data
* Design an interactive report to highlight major sales data

** Discliamer: This project was done as part of a course undertaken in Udemy. The creation of the dashboard was done soley by me, although some parts were guided with text with the course manual. The dashboard highlighting USA sales was not part of the course mandate, but was done as a drill through to further explore the USA sales.
